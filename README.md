# Hack@Brown 2019: Choreolab üíÉ
Project by Isabella Berry, Boubacar Diallo, and Ajani Stewart

## Inspiration ‚ú®
Choreolab Europe:
* An international and collaborative artistic research platform for dance and choreography. It provides an artistic playground for choreographers, dancers and movers from all over the world, where specific ideas on creation for movement and performance are researched in a peer-to-peer setting. http://www.choreolab.eu/

Past participants have said:

* "Half of the day was spent in a ‚Äúplayground‚Äù session, meaning that all of these curiosities we had brought to the table on day one could be talked or danced out in turn in 30 minute chunks of time." https://www.rubyjosephine.com/blog/choreolab-basel

By creating an app based on this workshop, our goal is to encourage fun and creativity through dance for people of all ages and backgrounds, even for those who are too old to play on playgrounds anymore.
